        <p class="bodyText"> Hi, my name is Cynthia Liu and I am a rising senior at Lynbrook High School. I have been immersed in web development (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) since middle school. I began learning different programming languages such as Python and Java starting in high school. Some of my hobbies include music, art, swimming and baking. More specifically, I enjoy playing the french horn, composing music, and painting. I also spend time at the pool coaching younger kids, playing music for seniors and hanging out with my friends.</p>
